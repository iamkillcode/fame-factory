# **App Name**: Fame Factory

## Core Features:

- Artist Genesis: Define artist name, gender, genre, and backstory to personalize the gaming experience.
- Cycle Management: Implement a weekly turn-based system for managing artist activities such as recording, performing, and social interactions.
- Music Manager: Track releases, manage associated metadata (lyrical theme, featured artists) and fan reactions to the track releases. Manage release of songs, mixtapes, and albums, and gauge market response based on style and genre using clear, dynamic graphs and metrics.
- Stats Dashboard: Show clear stats (Fame, Skills, Fanbase, Money, Reputation) progression in a digestible UI.
- Dynamic Events: The AI tool is capable of deciding when and how to inject scenarios, events, beefs (diss tracks, rivalries), and scandals, with multiple choice options for the user to react.
- Social Connect: Develop a social media interface where artists hype releases, start trends, and interact with fans.
- Music Forge: Automatically generates unique beats and lyric suggestions each turn, with styles (Love, Party, Struggle) for the player to select and mix. User determines a general song theme (for example 'Heartbreak') and the tool automatically chooses related words.

## Style Guidelines:

- Saturated purple (#9D4EDD) to convey creativity, ambition, and a touch of edginess suitable for the music industry theme. Use gradients and subtle animations to give it a liquid/glassy feel.
- Light purple (#F5EEFE), a desaturated version of the primary color, for a calm and clean backdrop. Add a subtle, animated noise texture to mimic the look of liquid.
- Blue-violet (#7400B8), a darker, analogous hue, used to highlight interactive elements and key information, adding depth and contrast to the interface. Also apply a glassy/transparent effect.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern and fashionable aesthetic. Use a slight glow effect to simulate light passing through glass.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) as the body font, when longer text needs to be displayed. Apply a subtle shadow to improve readability on the glassy background.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying song lyrics and other relevant song-related data. Give it a neon-like appearance for a modern vibe.
- Use sharp, vector-based icons to represent various in-game elements, enhancing user understanding and app navigation. Design the icons with a glossy, 3D appearance.
- Implement a grid-based layout to maintain an organized and visually appealing distribution of information. Give sections rounded corners and a slight transparency.
- Add subtle animations (e.g., transitions and loading screens) to provide an engaging and smooth user experience, celebrating in-game events and accomplishments. These animations should mimic fluid motion.
